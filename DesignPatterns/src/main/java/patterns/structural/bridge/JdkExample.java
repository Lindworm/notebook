 * BRIDGE JDK EXAMPLE
 * 
 * None comes to mind yet. 
 * A fictive example would be new LinkedHashMap(LinkedHashSet<K>, List<V>) 
 * which returns an unmodifiable linked map which doesn't clone the items, but uses them. 
 * The java.util.Collections#newSetFromMap() and singletonXXX() methods however comes close.
